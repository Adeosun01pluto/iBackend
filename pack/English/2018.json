        "In order to approach the problem of anxiety in play, let us consider the problem of anxiety in play, let us consider the activity of building and destroying a tower. Many a mother thinks that her little son is in a 'destructive stage' or even has a 'destructive personality' because after building a big, big tower, the boy cannot follow her advice to leave the tower for Daddy to see, but instead must kick it and make it collapse. The almost manic pleasure with which children watch the collapse in a second of the product of long play-labour has puzzled many, especially since the child does not appreciate it at all if his tower falls by accident or by a helpful uncle’s hand. He, the builder, must destroy it himself. This game, I should think, arises from the not so distant experience of sudden falls at the very time when standing upright on wobbly legs afforded a new and fascinating perspective on existence. The child who consequently learns to make a tower 'stand up' enjoys causing the same tower to waver and collapse; in addition to the active mastery over a previously passive event, it makes one feel stronger to know that there is somebody weaker ----and towers, unlike little sister, can't cry and call, 'Mummy!'According to this passage, it gives the child great pleasure"

        "A wolf, seeing a lamb drinking from a river, wanted to find a pretext for devouring him, He stood higher up the stream and accused the lamb of muddying the water so that he could not drink. The lamb said that he drank only the tip of his tongue and that in any case he was standing lower down the river, and could not possible disturb the water higher When this excuse failed him, the wolf said: 'Well, last year you insulted my father.' \"I wasn't even born then replied the lamb. 'You are good at finding answer' said the wolf, 'but what do you mean by taking up so much of the path where I am walking?' The lamb, frightened at the wolf's angry tone and terrible aspect, told him, with all due submission, that he could not conceive how his walking on such a wide path could occasion him any inconvenience. 'What!' exclaimed the wolf, seemingly in great anger and indignation. 'You are as impudent as your father who seized me by the throat last year and caused me to be kept in a cage for three months'. 'If you will believe me,' said the lamb, 'my parents are poor simple creatures who live entirely by green stuff, we are none of us hunters of your species.' Ah! I see it's no use talking to you,' said the wolf, drawing up close to him. 'it runs in the blood of your family to hate us wolves, and therefore,as we have come so conveniently together, I'll just pay off a few of your forefathers scores before we part.' So saying, he leapt at the lamb from behind and garotted him. Adapted from Bennet. C.H(1978)Which of the following aptly describes the moral of the story?"

        "In order to approach the problem of anxiety in play, let us consider the activity of building and destroying a tower. Many a mother thinks that her son is in a ‘destructive stage’ or even has a ‘destructive personality’ because after building a big, big tower, the boy cannot follow her advice to leave the tower for Daddy to see, but instead must kick it and make it collapse. The almost manic pleasure with which children watch the collapse in a second of the product of long play-labor has puzzles many, especially since the child does not appreciate it at all if his tower falls by accident or by a helpful uncle’s hand. He, the builder must destroy it himself. This game, I should think arises from the not so distant experience of sudden falls at the very time when standing upright on wobbly legs afforded a new and fascinating perspective on existence. The child who consequently learns to make a tower ‘stand up’ enjoys causing the same tower to waver and collapse; in addition to the active mastery over a previous passive event, it makes one feel stronger to know that there is somebody weaker-and towers, unlike little sister, can’t cry and call ‘mummy’According to this passage, it gives the child great pleasure "

        "In order to approach the problem of anxiety in play, let us consider the problem of anxiety in play, let us consider the activity of building and destroying a tower. Many a mother thinks that her little son is in a 'destructive stage' or even has a 'destructive personality' because after building a big, big tower, the boy cannot follow her advice to leave the tower for Daddy to see, but instead must kick it and make it collapse. The almost manic pleasure with which children watch the collapse in a second of the product of long play-labour has puzzled many, especially since the child does not appreciate it at all if his tower falls by accident or by a helpful uncle’s hand. He, the builder, must destroy it himself. This game, I should think, arises from the not so distant experience of sudden falls at the very time when standing upright on wobbly legs afforded a new and fascinating perspective on existence. The child who consequently learns to make a tower 'stand up' enjoys causing the same tower to waver and collapse; in addition to the active mastery over a previously passive event, it makes one feel stronger to know that there is somebody weaker ----and towers, unlike little sister, can't cry and call, 'Mummy!'According to this passage, it gives the child great pleasure"

Many a mother thinks that her little son is in a 'destructive stage' or even has a 'destructive personality' because after building a big, big tower, the boy cannot follow her advice to leave the tower for Daddy to see, but instead must kick it and make it collapse. The almost manic pleasure with which children watch the collapse in a second of the product of long play-labour has puzzled many, especially since the child does not appreciate it at all if his tower falls by accident or by a helpful uncle’s hand. He, the builder, must destroy it himself. This game, I should think, arises from the not so distant experience of sudden falls at the very time when standing upright on wobbly legs afforded a new and fascinating perspective on existence. The child who consequently learns to make a tower 'stand up' enjoys causing the same tower to waver and collapse; in addition to the active mastery over a previously passive event, it makes one feel stronger to know that there is somebody weaker ----and towers, unlike little sister, can't cry and call, 'Mummy!'What other feeling does the child derive from the fall of his tower apart from pleasure?"

        "A wolf, seeing a lamb drinking from a river, wanted to find a pretext for devouring him, He stood higher up the stream and accused the lamb of muddying the water so that he could not drink. The lamb said that he drank only the tip of his tongue and that in any case he was standing lower down the river, and could not possible disturb the water higher When this excuse failed him, the wolf said: 'Well, last year you insulted my father.' \"I wasn't even born then replied the lamb. 'You are good at finding answer' said the wolf, 'but what do you mean by taking up so much of the path where I am walking?' The lamb, frightened at the wolf's angry tone and terrible aspect, told him, with all due submission, that he could not conceive how his walking on such a wide path could occasion him any inconvenience. 'What!' exclaimed the wolf, seemingly in great anger and indignation. 'You are as impudent as your father who seized me by the throat last year and caused me to be kept in a cage for three months'. 'If you will believe me,' said the lamb, 'my parents are poor simple creatures who live entirely by green stuff, we are none of us hunters of your species.' Ah! I see it's no use talking to you,' said the wolf, drawing up close to him. 'it runs in the blood of your family to hate us wolves, and therefore,as we have come so conveniently together, I'll just pay off a few of your forefathers scores before we part.' So saying, he leapt at the lamb from behind and garotted him. Adapted from Bennet. C.H(1978)Which of the following aptly describes the moral of the story?"
