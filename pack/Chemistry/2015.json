      "explanation": "Thanks to the second law of thermodynamics, we know that the entropy of the final mixture has to be equal to or greater than the initially isolated systems. This means that the answer cannot be that the entropy decreases. Equality occurs just when the two original systems have all their respective intensive variables (temperature, pressure) equal; then the final system also has the same values. If we were dealing with two identical gases, then the answer would have been that the entropy will remain unchanged.",
