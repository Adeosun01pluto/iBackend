      "explanation": "The Local Government Reform 1976 was a nationwide undertaking by the military government as part of its intention to return power to civilians, sort of a precursor to active comprehensive political action, it was also designed to spread government programmes to the grassroots and to institutionalize the local government system in Nigeria. The reform resulted in the creation of 301 local governments across the country of varying populations between 150,000- 800,000.Prior to the 1976 reform, the local government system in the country was less autonomous with the colonial era Native Authorities serving as an avenue of policy implementation directed from Lagos. Towards independence, a system of elected councils was created but after independence the power of the system was minimal.The federal government has been a major source of local government finance through allocations since the 1976 reform.",
