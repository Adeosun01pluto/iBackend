Hence an object at the pole is closer to the earth's center than the one at the equator. The weight of a body at the poles should be more than that of when weighed at the equator.Thus weight varies from place to place while the mass of a body being the quantity of matter it contains remains the same at different points on the earth.",

The weight of a body at the poles should be more than that of when weighed at the equator.Thus weight varies from place to place while the mass of a body being the quantity of matter it contains remains the same at different points on the earth.",
