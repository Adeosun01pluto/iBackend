      "explanation": "The human appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the upper limbs, the lower limbs, the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle. The pectoral girdle acts as the point of attachment of the upper limbs to the body. The upper limb consists of the arm, the forearm, and the wrist and hand.The pelvic girdle is responsible for bearing the weight of the body and is responsible for locomotion; it is also responsible for attaching the lower limbs to the body. The lower limbs, including the thighs, legs, and feet, support the entire weight of the body and absorb the resulting forces from locomotion.",

Even the simpler organisms must be adapted in a great variety of ways: in their structure, physiology, and genetics, in their locomotion or dispersal, in their means of defense and attack, in their reproduction and development, and in other respects.Evolution explains how living things change over a long time, and how they have come to be the way they areVariation is any difference between cells, individual organisms, or groups of organisms of any species caused either by genetic differences (genotypic variation) or by the effect of environmental factors on the expression of the genetic potentials (phenotypic variation). Variation may be shown in physical appearance, metabolism, fertility, mode of reproduction, behaviour, learning and mental ability.Succession is the process by which the structure of a biological community evolves over time. Two different types of succession—primary and secondary—have been distinguished. Primary succession occurs in essentially lifeless areas—regions in which the soil is incapable of sustaining life as a result of such factors as lava flows, newly formed sand dunes, or rocks left from a retreating glacier.Secondary succession occurs in areas where a community that previously existed has been removed; it is typified by smaller-scale disturbances that do not eliminate all life and nutrients from the environment.",

The arrows indicate the passage of food, and therefore energy flow, from one organism to another.Pyramids of energy are the most accurate representation of feeding relationships in a community, providing information about the amount of energy flowing through each trophic level over a set period of time.Food web involve many complex feeding relationship and most most ecosystems are more complex than food chain",

Tree growth is controlled not only by rainfall but also by soil type; large areas of hardpan soils, allow no tree roots to penetrate except through cracks, and the cracks determine tree distribution.Large mammals are at their most diverse in this open environment, in which they can move about freely and yet find shelter among woody vegetation. Large herbivores are successful because of the tremendous biomass of herbaceous vegetation produced annually, and there are many carnivores to crop them in turn.Tropical rain forests occur in areas of tropical rainforest climate in which there is no dry season, distinct buttress roots of trees.Montane forest refers to any ecosystem found in mountains. These ecosystems are strongly affected by climate, which gets colder as elevation increases.

Pivot joints also provide for the twisting movement of the bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) against the upper arm.The ball and socket joint (or spheroidal joint) is a type of synovial joint which enables the bone to move in many places (nearly all directions).
